<h1 id="coding">What is coding?</h1>
<p> Electronic devices like cell phones, laptops, and tablets require code to function properly. Coding allows humans to communicate with these devices. Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators, smart TVs, and cars use internal coding systems.

Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as a translator. Code converts human input into numerical sequences that computers understand. Once computers receive these messages, they complete assigned tasks such as changing font colors or centering an image.

Read on to learn about how people use code to communicate with computers and develop electronic devices, machines, and other technologies.

How Does Coding Work?
Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions. Computer coding functions much like a manual.

A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a visual or to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run a successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions included in the coded manual.

 
Programming languages provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies.

Users interact with websites and apps with the help of these coded instructions. The code itself does not show up on the screen. Instead, people see the words and images a developer or programmer asks the computer to display.

Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies. Each programming language helps humans accurately communicate with machines.

Types of Programming Languages
Binary code comprises a series of zeros and ones, used to communicate instructions. This code is a low-level programming language. Each digit in a coded sequence connects to a switch in your computer. Each switch connects to an action, and together thousands of switches operate a device.

High-level code, a computer communication process that works much like human language, allows programmers to operate entire systems simultaneously. High-level programming languages convert human language from programmers into binary code that computers understand.<p></p>

<h2 class="heading"id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.</p>
<h2 class="heading"id="`Arrays">Arrays</h2>
<p>An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.[1]

    Depending on the language, array types may overlap (or be identified with) other data types that describe aggregates of values, such as lists and strings. Array types are often implemented by array data structures, but sometimes by other means, such as hash tables, linked lists, or search trees.[2] In Python, the built-in array data structure is a list.</p>
<h2 class="heading"id="If Statements">If Statements</h2>
<p>The IF statement is a decision-making statement that guides a program to make decisions based on specified criteria</p>
<h2 class="heading"id="Loops">Loops</h2>
<p>In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached</p>
<h2 class="heading"id="Operators">Operators</h2>
<p>In mathematics and computer programming, an operator is a character that represents a specific mathematical or logical action or process.</p>

<h2 id="codingproject">What is a coding project?</h2>
<p>A coding project is a focused venture wherein a coder (or group of coders) applies their programming skills to a specific project. These can take anywhere from a couple weeks to a full year.

  Ultimately, the goal of a coding project is to hone your skills.
  
  Your coding project may range in timeframe because of new elements you decide to tack on, unexpected errors or challenges that pop up, or other time commitments that interfere.
  
  The best thing to remember is that you want to finish the project, so aim for something small and manageable to begin with.
  </p>
<h1 class="heading"id="codeProject">Ideas for a small coding project:</h1>

<p class="heading" id="BuildSkills"></p>Build your skills as you work through fun, progressively challenging courses.

 <h1 class="heading"id="javasriptgame">A small JavaScript game</h1>
<p> Whether or not you’re a gamer, simply JavaScript games are a great way to create something interactive that poses a challenge to users.<p

You can also integrate other programming languages such as HTML and CSS, giving you the added challenge of creating certain functionalities (think running and jumping), and the ability to flesh out some basic design elements with CSS.

For something more simple, consider building out a chess game or tic-tac-toe.</p>

<h1 class="heading"id="countdowntimer">Countdown timer or calculator</h1>
</p> test your programming skills for numbers, try a countdown timer or calculator. You’ll need to create a layout and an algorithm that can process numbers and make calculations, and/or work with a calendar that counts down to a scheduled event.

Generally, you can expect to use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and NoSQL on this type of project.</p>

<h1 class="heading" id="conversiontool">Create a conversion tool</h1>
    </p>While currency conversion could be an interesting project, consider the ever-fluctuating market value of currency exchanges and how difficult that might be to track.</p>
